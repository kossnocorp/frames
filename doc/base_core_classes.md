# Base core classes

Frames has few core classes that doesn't have any dependencies but required for
other core and base classes.

_Caution! Currently Frames depends on other libraries such a Sugar.js and
jQuery. One of the main priorities is a remove these dependencies. But currently
not everything in this document reflects the present state of Frames_
