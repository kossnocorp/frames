# Core classes

Along with [zero-dependecy base core classes](./base_core_classes.md) Frames
functionality depends on few core classes that depends on _base core classes_.

They are 100% replaceble and optional.

* [Frames.Launcher](./core/launcher.md)
* [Frames.RoutersFactory](./core/routers_factory.md)
* [Frames.ViewsFactory](./core/routers_factory.md)
* [Frames.Deferred](./core/deferred.md)
